This website is a personal homepage. I write software and sometimes prolifically when inspired.

My family's present residence is in The Netherlands where we are staying for the last nine years. Life is busy for my dear wife and myself with two growing boys. I turn 40 in February, 2018.

I am an Indian citizen and have travelled across the globe, living in some places, breezing through others.


> I enjoy the mountains, beaches, first flush Darjeeling tea and my favourite pastime is walking the streets of old Calcutta, a city which I miss very much. 

I hate cooking, ironing and gardening and go to great lengths to outsource the same to other great humans/bots often at a hefty price.
