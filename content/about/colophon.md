This website is a personal homepage. I write software and sometimes prolifically when inspired.

My family's present residence is in The Netherlands where we are staying for the last nine years. Life is busy for my dear wife and myself with two growing boys. I turn 40 in February, 2018.

I am an Indian citizen and have travelled across the globe, living in some places, breezing through others.

The site is built with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//gohugo.io">Hugo</a>â€”a static site generator made with Go. The website [source code](/https://github.com/dwaiba/blogcloudgear) is available on GitHub. It uses the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme">cocoa</a> theme as a submodule. The posts are written in Markdown.

The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.

If you find errors, [please let me know](mailto:dwai@cloudgear.io).
